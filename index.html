								<h3>Data Visualizations</h3>
								<p>Using Python packages like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly I create meaningful visualizations to drive my exploratory data analysis and convey my findings from predictive models. I create scatter plots, bar and line charts, pie charts, heatmaps, cloropleth graphs, as well as statistical graphs like boxplots and histograms. Aggregating data and plotting in various ways helps people outside of data specialists understand the dataset and view trends.</p>

								<h3>Data Analytics</h3>
								<p>I have a passion for identifying trends in data. My statistical knowledge combined with my technical skills make me an excellent data analyst. Using data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy, I can calculate central tendency measures and view the distributions for data to understand if, why, and how something occurred in the dataset. I have experience doing analyses with datasets on Kaggle, as well as webscraping and using APIs to analyze web data.</p>

								<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
								<p>My deep foundational understanding of popular models like regression, neural networks, and K nearest neighbors gives me an advantage when implementing algorithms with Scikit-Learn. My skill for data analytics assists in the ML pipeline when performing exploratory data analysis. I have a strong appreciation for hyperparameter tuning, in which I utilize K-fold cross-validation, validation curves, and grid search to optimize parameters. I have trained models on standard datasets and corporate data. I have strong skills in NLP, where I have experience using NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim. I have also experimented with unsupervised learning techniques like LDA and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/nplotko/IMDB-movie-reviews">IMDB Movie Review Analysis and Classification</a></h3>
								<p><strong>Personal Project</strong><br>Using the famous IMDB dataset (taken from Kaggle), I performed exploratory data analysis, created wordclouds, and pre-processed using TF-IDF vectorization. Then, I performed cross-validation on logistic regression and K nearest neighbor models using sklearn's validation_curve to visualize the increase in accuracy over the hyperparameter setting. I also compared this to LinearSVC. The packages used in this project were Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, and SpaCy.</p>

								<h3>Analysis of Sitewide Feedback</h3>
								<p><strong>Project for Data Science and Machine Learning Internship at ADP</strong><br>Led the project kickoff to streamline to process for viewing sitewide feedback of a product. I experimented with unsupervised learning models like LDA (topic modeling) and UMAP with HDBSCAN (clustering). I also built a multi-label topic classification model identifying whether feedback was about support, system performance, UI/UX issues, and more. To do this, I fine-tuned SBERT to perform this task. I also trained a classifier to predict the sentiment around feedback. </p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/nplotko/university-data-EDA">Analysis of University Data</a></h3>
								<p><strong>Personal Project</strong><br>To learn more about the Plotly library of Python, I performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset relating to university data. This dataset includes world rank, teaching scores, research scores, the number of students, the female/male ratio, and more. The exploratory data analysis consists of bar charts, line charts, wordclouds, and scatter plots. Everything built with Plotly is interactive. Here, I tried to learn what qualities make a university ranked higher, so I performed linear regression to predict the total score of a university given the features of the dataset.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/nplotko/double-descent-lr">Experiments with Overparameterized Linear Regression Models</a></h3>
								<p><strong>Project for Foundations of Modern Data Science Class </strong><br>After researching the novel "Double Descent Phenomenon," I conducted a series of experiments with randomly generated data to understand and visualize this phenomenon's relation to linear regression. One experiment replicates the work of Preetum Nakkiran, while the others were based on my own research. As this project featured a form of linear regression unapplicable to sklearn's estimator, I performed the linear algebra calculations to train the models used here. I also used PyTorch to speed up the matrix operations.</p>

								<h3>Applied Data Science Capstone</h3>
								<p><strong>Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera</strong><br>Given a few datasets containing information on SpaceX rocket launches, I performed the full data science pipeline. This included data cleaning, normalization, and exploratory data analysis, in which I created a dashboard using Plotly's Dash package. Using this dashboard, I learned correlations between rocket characteristics and launch failures. I, then, performed feature engineering and created a classifier to predict successful missions with multiple algorithms and analyzed the effect of payload mass on landing success rates.</p>

								<h3>Drone Grocery Delivery Database</h3>
								<p><strong>Project for Database Systems Class</strong><br>In this class, I was given a series of 15 screens outlining the full functionality of a drone grocery delivery system with users including grocery store managers, drone technicians, and customers. Customers would pick a grocery store, select the groceries and quantities, and place an order. This order would be mapped to a drone to then deliver the groceries. From these screens, I created an ERD and mapped it to a relational schema. In SQL, I created the database, inserted the data into the database, and created procedures for the functionality of all users.</p>

								<h3>Predicting Life Expectancy from Immunizations and Socio-Economic Factors</h3>
								<p><strong>Project for Regression and Forecasting Class</strong><br>Using a Kaggle dataset, my team built multiple regression models and performed factor analysis to determine what the most significant factors were in predicting life expectancy for several countries. First, we cleaned the data. Next, we checked the assumptions for linear regression (constant variance and normality) and transformed the data to fix issues with collinearity of features. We used several techniques such as forward/backward selection, stepwise regression, and best subsets regression to learn the most significant features, and we used RMSE and R-squared as our accuracy measures. The most significant features found were mortality rates, deaths under 5 years of age, GDP, infant deaths, status of country (developing or developed), total government expenditure percentage, income composition of resources, and alcohol usage. With these features, the team was able to obtain an R-squared value of 83.76 percent. This project was done completely using R.</p>
